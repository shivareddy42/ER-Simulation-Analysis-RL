    """
    Runs a discrete-event simulation of an emergency room for a given simulation time.
    Uses service time distributions (registration, triage, medical consultation) derived from real data.
    Returns overall metrics along with time-series data (wait times and queue lengths).
    
    Parameters:
      - num_doctors: Number of doctors available.
      - num_nurses: Number of nurses available.
      - arrival_rate: Patient arrival rate (patients per hour).
      - sim_time: Simulation time in minutes (default is 240 minutes = 4 hours).
